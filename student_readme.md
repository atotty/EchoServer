# Student README

This is _your_ README. Use this space to share how you approached the problems of this project. This need not be a diary, but should contain information about decisions you made, challenges you faced, and your understanding of the content of the project. 

- What challenges did you face while completing the project? How did you address them?  
- How did you test your code? Explicitly describe examples of your test cases. 
- (Bonus 2 pts.) Provide suggestions of how you would improve the documentation, sample code, testing, or other aspects of the project (up to 2 points extra credit available for noteworthy suggestions here, e.g., actual descriptions of how you would change things, sample code, code for tests, etc.) You will not receive bonus points for simply reporting an issue - you should provide actionable suggestions on how to improve things
